The TN-QuMAT outreach program, in partnership with Vanderbilt University's [ViNSE Institute](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/vinse/), successfully hosted a hands-on training workshop titled "From Atoms to Quantum Materials to Quantum Computers."

The event attracted over 60  participants, including faculty members, postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students. The workshop introduced participants to quantum science, quantum materials, and quantum computing through practical activities.
Participants engaged in hands-on coding exercises using IBM's quantum computers and the Qiskit programming framework, exploring how quantum information is stored and manipulated using qubits, and experimenting with quantum gates and circuits. Additionally, the workshop highlighted the pivotal role advanced quantum materials play in driving forward quantum computing technologies.
