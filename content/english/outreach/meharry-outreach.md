**TN-QuMat** recently partnered with Meharry Medical College (Dr. Lei Qian) and Fisk University to host a two-day Summer Quantum Training Workshop, led by Dr. Hanna Terletska (MTSU), for undergraduate students from across different STEM disciplines.

Held on the campuses of Fisk University and Meharry Medical College in Nashville, TN, this hands-on workshop welcomed students from Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, Oregon, and Indiana. The program offered a unique opportunity to explore the foundations of quantum science through interactive lectures, simulations, and lab-based exercises.

This workshop was part of the larger [Undergraduate Summer Research Internship Program](https://ms-cc.org/about-us/undergraduate-summer-research-internship/) hosted at Fisk University in partnership with Meharry Medical College. The 10-week internship prepares students to apply computational and data-intensive approaches to research across multiple disciplines, including emerging quantum technologies.

Participants engaged in training modules such as:

- Introduction to quantum materials
- Modeling phase transitions using the tight-binding model
- Fundamentals of superconductivity
- A hands-on quantum computing session using IBMâ€™s Qiskit platform to simulate and run quantum circuits on real quantum hardware

This immersive experience was designed to build foundational skills and spark student interest in quantum science and engineering. TN-QuMat continues to expand access to quantum science training and build a national network of undergraduate talent to support a competitive U.S. quantum workforce.
