  content: "The **TN-QuMat** project is a strategic partnership between **MTSU**, **TSU**, **Fisk University**, **Meharry College**, and **Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)**.
Supported by the DOE-RENEW program, the TN-QuMat advances DOE’s mission by developing a skilled and diverse workforce in quantum science, an area critical to the nation’s scientific and technological importance.
TN-QuMat provides hands-on research training and mentorship focused on three major thrusts in quantum materials science: 1) Theoretical modeling, 2) First-principles simulations, and 3) Experimental synthesis and characterization of quantum materials.

The program supports participants across all career stages, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. Trainees benefit from structured research opportunities, internships at ORNL, and multi-tiered mentoring from both academic and national lab scientists.

Beyond individual training, TN-QuMat aims to expand institutional research capacity in quantum science by investing in faculty development, fostering inter-institutional collaboration, and deepening strategic partnerships with ORNL.

By combining cutting-edge research with inclusive workforce development, TN-QuMat is cultivating a robust, diverse quantum-ready talent pipeline and accelerating regional innovation in quantum materials."

#This Middle Tennessee–based consortium is building a robust regional ecosystem for quantum research, education, and workforce development, empowering students, postdocs, and faculty across career stages through hands-on training, mentoring, and national lab collaboration."
