## Overview

The TN-QuMat Workshop will introduce participants to state-of-the-art methods in quantum materials research, with a special focus on the interplay of disorder, correlations, topology, and dimensionality. Topics include many-body theory, ab initio simulations, machine learning for materials discovery, and experimental advances in synthesis and characterization. Hands-on sessions will provide practical training in DCA++/ALPS, density functional theory (DFT), AI for materials science, and quantum computing applications.

The workshop is aimed at graduate students and postdocs entering the field, but senior undergraduates and other interested participants are also welcome (space permitting).

This is an in-person event. We especially encourage participation from across Tennessee and neighboring states, and welcome anyone interested in exploring cutting-edge research and training in quantum materials.


## Topics

A lineup of invited speakers will cover topics including (but not limited to):

- Quantum many-body theory and simulation
- Introduction to density functional theory
- Synthesis and characterization of quantum materials
- Machine learning in materials science  
- Quantum computing for quantum materials
- Hand-on training sessions
- HPC computing

  ## Anticipated workshop capacity: 40 participants
