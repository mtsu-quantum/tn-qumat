### Overview

The TN-QuMat Workshop will introduce participants to state-of-the-art methods in quantum materials research, with a special focus on the interplay of disorder, correlations, topology, and dimensionality. Topics include many-body theory, ab initio simulations, machine learning for materials discovery, and experimental advances in synthesis and characterization. Hands-on sessions will provide practical training in DCA++/ALPS, density functional theory (DFT), AI for materials science, and quantum computing applications.

The workshop is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and other interested participants are also welcome (space permitting).

We especially encourage participation from across Tennessee and neighboring states, and welcome anyone interested in exploring cutting-edge research and training in quantum materials.

### Dates: Friday, November 7, 2025 
### Location:Tennessee State University
Address: 1112 37th Avenue North, Nashville, Tennessee 37209  
Note: this is an in-person event (some remote access might be provided upon request).
