### Overview

The TN-QuMat Workshop will introduce participants to state-of-the-art methods in quantum materials research, with a special focus on the interplay of disorder, correlations, topology, and dimensionality. Topics include many-body theory, ab initio simulations, machine learning for materials discovery, and experimental advances in synthesis and characterization. Hands-on sessions will provide practical training in DCA++/ALPS, density functional theory (DFT), AI for materials science, and quantum computing applications.

**The workshop is aimed at undergraduate and beginning graduate students from all STEM majors, faculty and other interested participants are also welcome (space permitting).**

We especially encourage participation from across Tennessee and neighboring states, and welcome anyone interested in exploring cutting-edge research and training in quantum materials.
